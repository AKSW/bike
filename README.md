The growth and evolution of our civilization have been based on the use of biodiversity. Human survival was much sustained by the use of plant species, especially for nutrition and medicinal uses. Natural products are the most traditional source for the design and development of new drugs. Taking into account all drugs approved worldwide, 67% are either a natural product, semi-synthetic derivative, macromolecule isolated from an organism, or have a pharmacophore group inspired by a natural product. Natural products researchers have been studying the medicinal properties of plants and great advances regarding biosynthesis, ecology and biological properties were achieved in the last century. Unfortunately, many species are endangered of extinction, and their chemistry, genes, and biological properties of them would also be lost. The chemical diversity of the worldâ€™s flora and fauna is revealed by its diverse chemical compound classes and structural types of secondary metabolites from plants, fungi, insects, marine organisms, and bacteria. 

The knowledge of over 50 years of studies on biodiversity available in scientific articles can become easier accessible when organized and shared through knowledge graphs. It can assist in the development of different fields of science, and bio-friendly products with high added value as well as guide public policies to bring benefits both to science and to strengthen the bio-economy. All these benefits demonstrate the need for organized and standardized policies and procedures to produce high-quality and valuable information. In this sense, the Semantic Web architecture choices can facilitate the publishing, sharing, and consuming of this valuable information among researchers and leading institutions. Once the data is in the RDF format, contributions from the wide range of the so-called Linked Data fields such as knowledge discovery, machine learning, data fusion, information retrieval, and data quality can help to foster sustainable growth of biochemical data as well as facilitate harvest all its potential to a more environmentally conscious society. 

However, to date, most of the structured biochemical information available on the Web is manually curated, and it is practically impossible to keep pace with the research being constantly published in scientific articles. Within this challenge, we want to speed up and promote research on automatic biochemical knowledge extraction mechanisms by the Semantic Web scientific community with the aim of increasing the information available on natural products to promote the development of environmental-friendly products while increasing the community's awareness of the biodiversity value.
